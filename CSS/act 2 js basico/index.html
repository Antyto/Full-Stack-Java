                <h2>JavasCript Basics</h2>
                <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweigth laguage allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
                    directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="vdecl.html">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
                        with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span>var=x</span></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="vassig.html">Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a
                        variable. <span>var=10</span></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="dtypes.html">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or
                        <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, "Coding", 2, "Dojo"]</span> and Objects - <span>{first_name: "Jane", last_name: "Doe"}</span></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="condit.html">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use conditional statements
                        in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                        condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="loops.html">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around
                        the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="func.html">Functions</a>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from
                        Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished out instructions. Sadly there a a ton more table to do so lets call our function
                        over and over again.</li>
